# Grids
An introduction to writing a program that employs multiple functions.

The program will take input of a grid, which is represented as a list of lists, such as: 
3 4 3 9  
8 6 9 1  
5 9 4 3  
1 8 7 2 

The entries in the grid will all be integers from 1 to 9. We refer to the position of a grid entry as (row, column). Along with a grid, the input will include a target from 1 to 9 and a direction from 0 to 7. These directions correspond to the eight orthogonal and diagonal directions that point at the neighbors of a grid entry. We will use 0 for straight north, 1 for northeast, 2 for east, and so on, to 7 for northwest. For example, from the 5 in position (2, 0) we see 8 in direction 0, 6 in direction 1, etc. Because 5 is on the edge of the grid, there are no neighbors in directions 5 through 7. As another example, we observe that the neighbor of the 7 in position (3, 2) in direction 6 is 8. The program should accept a square grid, a target, and a direction. 

The program should then output: the same grid with every instance of the search number replaced with 0; the position(s) of these 0s; the sum of all grid entries that neighbored the targets in the given direction
