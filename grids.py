   DESCRIPTION: The program is going to ask user to input a grid, a targeted
                number, and the direction. Then it is going to scan over this
                given squared grid of number and locate the targeted number 
                within the grid. When the target is found, this program is 
                going print out the locations of the target. The program is 
                also going to print a copy of the given grid with all the 
                targeted number turned into zero. Then, this program is going 
                to add all the numbers in the given direction from the 
                targeted number.
                
                Here is another sample interaction with the program.
